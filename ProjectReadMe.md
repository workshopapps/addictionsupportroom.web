# SoberPal

Hello Guys,
This is the sober pal repository. If you got an invite it means you're an FE dev on the mechinal-cranckshaft team.

I'm creating this readme file to guide us on how to use this repo to avoid conflicts and bugs.
Step 1:
Fork the repo.
Step 2: 
Clone the repo on your pc
Step 3:
Always push to a dev branch so it can be reviewed before merging to the main branch.
Step 4:
Always check for update and pull from the main branch. Don't forget to always work on your dev branch.
Step 5: 
Install prettier to always format your code.
Step 6:
If you're using pure css always use the BEM naming convention to avoid css bleeding.
Step 7: 
Properly describe your commit message like the format we used in the stage 2 project.
Step 8:
Make pull-requests after finishing each task.

THANKS
