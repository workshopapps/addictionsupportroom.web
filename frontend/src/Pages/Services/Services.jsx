          <p>
            The NHS website has a dedicated content team. It has a clear mandate
            to produce accurate, balanced and transparent information that meets
            the needs of users
          </p>
          <p>
            No member of staff will be asked, or is permitted, to provide
            favoured treatment to any partner organisation, and all staff must
            fully disclose any financial or other interests they may have in any
            healthcare-related companies or organisations. Such interests must
            be reported to the site's Content Director at the time of employment
            or at the point the interests arise thereafter.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Content Director will report any potential conflict of interest
            to the Programme's Director and the Programme's Clinical Lead who
            will determine what needs to be done to eliminate it. Where content
            is produced by outside organisations or individuals, NHS.UK requires
            that such agents make a similar disclosure of outside interests.
          </p>
          <p>Training</p>
          <p>
            All content team members are given training to ensure editorial
            standards are met. Specifically, they are trained to search for and
            review high-quality evidence to make sure that content is factually
            and clinically accurate.

          <p>
            The Programme's Clinical Lead, reporting to NHS Digital's Chief
            Medical Officers, is accountable for making sure the content we
            publish has a clear evidence base, is clinically safe, meets users'
            needs and supports the NHS.
          </p>
          <p>
            The Content Director is accountable for the maintenance of general
            editorial standards, in particular for making sure that content
            meets the Standard for creating health content (in the NHS digital
            service manual).
          </p>
          <p>Research</p>
          <p>
            The evidence-based knowledge that informs all NHS.UK content is
            derived from:
          </p>
          <p>user research with patients and the public</p>
          <p>the most authoritative clinical sources</p>
          <p>
            direct experience of clinicians and other health professionals In
            pulling together this knowledge to provide users with a rounded and
            balanced package of material on a particular subject, the NHS
            website requires its staff and contractors to consult the following
            resources.
          </p>
          <p>
            For peer-reviewed scientific research, they consult reputable
            sources of clinical evidence, such as the National Institute for
            Health and Care Excellence (NICE) and Clinical Knowledge Summaries
            (CKS). Where knowledge of direct experience is required, they
            consult: patients and members of the public who may be affected by a
            topic or issue
          </p>
          <p>
            practising doctors and other clinicians with direct and current
            experience in dealing with or treating the health issue under
            investigation
          </p>
          <p>medical royal colleges</p>

          <p>Policy sign-off</p>
          <p>
            Prior to publication, if there is a relevant policy, content must
            also be read by an appropriate policy official, either at the
            Department of Health and Social Care or NHS England, who checks it
            for alignment with that policy.

            necessary. Publication dates are displayed on all content.

          <p>
            We are developing various new content products that are tested with
            the public before they go live. We signpost to users that these are
            prototypes and not final products. Not all the provisions of this
            policy apply to content in development.
          </p>
